### 1) Which project elements are on track?

The DNS Servers and file server are on track. Both were completed according to their respective deadlines. The file server
deadline was set as October 23 and it was completed on October 22. The deadline for setting up the DNS Servers was set as
October 16. The initial configuration was completed on October 16 and extra troubleshooting was completed in the days 
that followed.


### 2) Which elements are ahead of schedule and by how much? To what have you reallocated this time?

Deploying the Linux Client VM was initially planned to be completed by November 15, however we're currently in the process
of completing its configuration. As of October 22, it has been configured as a client for the DNS, SMB and NTP services.
The Linux client will continue to be updated as new client services become available.
In addition, the Value Added #1 deliverable is approaching completion. This deliverable was originally scheduled to be completed
by November 15, but it is expected that it will be done by October 28.

### 4) Identify the root cause of the delay. Is there a way to prevent these delays in the future.

### 5) For each item behind schedule detail a strategy to get back on track.

### 6) Update your project plan and include it with these reflections. Indicate where changes have been made.

As of the time of this assignment submission, no elements are overdue.


### 7) Reflect upon your communications plan. 

Was it adequate thus far? Detail any changes you have made?
The communication plan has proven to be effective. Each of the weekly team meetings have been completed and the meeting minutes have
been posted in an accessible Microsoft OneDrive folder as planned (for future reference). So far the only change made to the proposed
schedule was to change the date of one of the meetings due to a timing conflict. This created no problems, since the meeting was 
rescheduled for the following day. As of today, there are no proposed changes to the communication plan and none are anticipated.


### 8) Examine your hardware plan. Is the hardware allocated to each virtual machine appropriate? Take this opportunity to right-size your virtual machines?




### 9) Examine your network plan. Is your network plan adequate?




### 10) Update your test plan for any completed services or features. Include your updated test plan in this document.




### 11) Are there any potential hurdles that your team can foresee at this point in the project?
